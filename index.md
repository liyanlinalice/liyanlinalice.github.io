# [](#header-1)About me.

<img src="ProfilePic.JPG" style="float: left; padding: 2em" width="25%">

 I am a first year graduate student of Statistics at University of California, Davis. I also graduate from Davis in 2016 with a B.S Bachelor degree in both Applied Math and Statistics.

At UC Davis, I have taken many coursework in math, statistics, economics and computer programing. These include classes such as Time Series Analysis, Mathematical Finance, and Machine Learning algorithms. My primary data analysis programing language is R. I have also had programing experience in Matlab, C, SQL, SAS, C++, and I am currently learning how to use python in data science. 

On this website page, you will find some of the projects I have done in classes or outside class. This include: 

*   This is an unordered list following a header.
*   [Link to another page](another-page).
*   [Link to assignment2 page](assignment/assignment2.html).
*   [hahahha](historydata_regression)
*   This is an unordered list following a header.

### There's a horizontal rule below this.

* * *

### Here is an unordered list:

*   Item foo
*   Item bar
*   Item baz
*   Item zip

### And an ordered list:

1.  Item one
1.  Item two
1.  Item three
1.  Item four

### And a nested list:

- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
    - level 3 item
    - level 3 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item

### Definition lists can be used with HTML syntax.

```
Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.

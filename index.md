## [](#header-1)About me.

<img src="ProfilePic.JPG" style="float: right; padding: 2em" width="30%">

 My name is Yanlin Li, also go by Alice. I am a master student in Statistics at University of California, Davis. I also graduated from Davis in 2016 with a B.S degree in both Applied Math and Statistics.

At UC Davis, I have taken coursework in math, statistics, computer programing and economics. These include classes such as Numerical Analysis, Time Series Analysis, Regression Analysis, Mathematical Finance, and Machine Learning algorithms. I primarily write code in R. I have also had programing experience in Matlab, C, SQL, SAS, and C++. I am currently learning how to conduct data analysis in Python. 

Below you will find some of the projects I have done in and outside of classes in the past, as well as my current project.

### There's a horizontal rule below this.

### Here is an unordered list:

*   Item foo
*   Item bar
*   Item baz
*   Item zip

### And an ordered list:

1.  Item one
1.  Item two
1.  Item three
1.  Item four

### And a nested list:

- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
    - level 3 item
    - level 3 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item

Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.

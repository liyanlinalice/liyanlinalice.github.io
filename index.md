 My name is Yanlin Li, also go by Alice. I am a master student in Statistics at University of California, Davis. I also graduated from Davis in 2016 with a B.S degree in both Applied Math and Statistics.

At UC Davis, I have taken coursework in math, statistics, computer programing and economics. These include classes such as Numerical Analysis, Time Series Analysis, Regression Analysis, Mathematical Finance, and Machine Learning algorithms. I primarily write code in R. I have also had programing experience in Matlab, C, SQL, SAS, and C++. I am currently learning how to conduct data analysis in Python. 

Below you will find some of the projects I have done in and outside of classes in the past, as well as my current project.
